# Rashberry PI
The rashberry PI is small computer that can either run Linux or Windows IoT Core. Currently the RPI 2 is running linux, which is good if you want to play with python or nodejs. While the 3 is installed with Windows IoT Core. It is good as a control unit in an IoT or SmartHome setup. I also have a camera, that can be used if you want to play with some object recognition from e.g. python. 

## Prerequsites
Not much, bring one, or borrow one of mines. 

## Project Idea
### Windows IoT Core App
Install Windows IoT Core on the Raspberry PI 3 (don't use the 2 it is super slow). Create an app, e.g. one that talks to the Texas Instrument sensor.
