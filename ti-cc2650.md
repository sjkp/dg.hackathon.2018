This sensor is a prototype boards that can measure 10 different things. It uses Bluetooth low energy, and can last quite a while on it battery, months to years, depending on how frequent it beacons it sensor data. 

It is not the easiet thing to work with, as it requires bluetooth, and I haven't found any great libraries for it. 

I have a demo application that can be used as a starting point. 
It is located here: 

It is also possible to connect to it from the RPI.
