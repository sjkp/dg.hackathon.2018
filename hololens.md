## Project Idea
### Face/Object Recognition 
Build an hololens app and integrate it with a face recognition/object recognition API, to allow for real time overlay of information about the object/people. 

Kicker combine it with the IoT sensors, so that when you look at a sensor you gets presented with its readings.
