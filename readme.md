# Delegate Hackathon 2018 


## Concept
The goal of the hackathon is to learn something new, ideally by incorporate some of the hardware devices into your solution. We only have 24 hours, so start with something tangible and extend upon it. You are not going to build a smart home platform in 24 hours, but you can build a end-to-end working solution even with some tech you haven't touched before. Since the hardware is probably new to most of us, then stick with a programming language/platform that you know, so that is not going to be an additional challenge.
